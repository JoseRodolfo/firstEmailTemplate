"This is my first email template!

I built this through a DevTips tutorial.

In order to declutter my code while building this template i used a different file for my scss.

I begun by installing node-sass through
npm to compile my scss.

When all code was set in html and scss, i compiled and pasted all css into head of (email.html) html file
within a style tag.

I created a duplicate file of my html (which later becomes my final file). Cut the "head"
and "body" tags out, and ran it through a css-inliner online.

I then copied that generated code back into my html duplicate (email-inline.html).

Wala all done!

My next templates will be designs from dribbble!

thanks!
